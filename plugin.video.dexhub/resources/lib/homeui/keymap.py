"""Back in the player keeps the video playing (v5.10.99, widened in 5.10.100).

Kodi's own keymaps stop the video on some Back buttons in the fullscreen
player: a game controller or Bluetooth remote's B button (joystick.xml,
gamepad.xml), the Menu button of an Apple remote (customcontroller maps), and
a held Back or Backspace on a keyboard or IR remote (keyboard.xml, where a slow
IR key release reads as a long press). Other add-ons can add their own: Stremio
for Kodi's map stops the video on every Back. While the
Dex Hub Home is open, this user keymap sends those to the GUI instead (Kodi's
FullScreen action), so Back returns to the Home and the video goes on playing
in its now-playing card. Stop stays on the player's own controls and on the
card.

The map is held while the Dex Hub Home is open and while a Dex Hub video
plays (the companion service holds it for its own playback), and removed when
neither needs it, so Kodi's and other add-ons' keys return. The service clears
one left behind by a crash when Kodi starts.

v5.10.111: Kodi drops every action, the keymap reload too, while the topmost
modal dialog plays its closing animation ("ignoring action 203" in kodi.log),
and that is just when the Home opens from a skin's menu: Kodi's busy dialog is
closing. The map was written but never read, and as the file stayed the same
it was never read later either, so Back stopped the video again. A reload now
waits until no dialog is closing and is sent a second time a moment later, and
the map is read again whenever Kodi may not have it yet.
