"""Background trailer playback for the Dex Hub Home windows.

One trailer at a time, played windowed so the hero's video layer shows it
behind the artwork gradients. The director owns every side effect of a
trailer so nothing leaks into real playback:

  * ``dexhub.trailer.active`` / ``dexhub.trailer.url`` on the Home window
    tell Dex Hub's playback companion (and any subtitle service that wants
    to check) that this playback is only a preview;
  * the ``dexhub.sub.*`` bridge properties from the last real playback are
    cleared before a trailer starts, so a subtitle service never searches
    for the previous title while a trailer runs;
  * the trailer item carries no ids and the generic ``video`` media type, so
    scrobblers ignore it;
  * silent previews turn Kodi's volume down to zero with the SetVolume
    builtin (Kodi's mute would flash the volume dialog on every trailer) and
    restore the user's level once the last preview has really stopped; a
    marker file holding that level lets the Dex Hub service restore it after
    a crash.

Two Kodi behaviours shape the threading here:

  * ``xbmc.Player().stop()`` waits until Kodi has closed the player, which
    can take seconds on some boxes. The window's callbacks run on a single
    thread, so a stop made there would freeze the remote. Stops requested by
    the UI therefore only flip the state and hand the real stop to a short
    background thread.
  * Kodi opens its modal busy dialog on every playback start, which would
    swallow key presses while a preview buffers; a guard thread cancels that
    dialog as soon as it appears (the preview keeps loading).

Moving from one title to the next parks the running preview (v5.10.103):
it is hidden and paused, not stopped, and the next title's preview takes over
the open player. Closing Kodi's player runs on Kodi's own interface thread
and can hold every screen for a moment on some boxes, so stopping a preview
on each move made browsing stutter; switching the file of an open player
does not. A parked preview that nothing takes over within a few seconds (the
cursor rests on a title with no trailer) is stopped for real, and leaving the
page or starting real playback stops it at once as before.

Kodi delivers player callbacks late and sometimes for the file that was just
replaced, so the director never trusts a single callback: a stop that arrives
while the next trailer is still starting is ignored, and a watchdog tick
(driven by the app) settles any state the callbacks missed. Window callbacks
are always made after the director's lock is released.

Live TV channels (v5.10.103) are previews too, opened through Kodi's PVR by
channel id. Kodi then reports the channel's stream address as the playing
file, never the address the preview was started with, so a channel preview
is recognised by the channel Kodi says is playing, and that stream address is
remembered as the preview's own from then on. A parked channel is silenced,
not paused: a live stream carries on, and coming back to it shows it live.
OK on a previewed channel hands it over as real playback (adopt).

Channels of the other live sources (v5.10.104: Stremio add-ons, the user's
subscription, M3U playlists and Xtream accounts) have a stream address of
their own. They open like a trailer, and live like a PVR channel: parking
silences them, coming back needs no resume, and OK adopts them. Each live
preview carries a key (the tile's path), so a page can tell which channel
the running preview is.
