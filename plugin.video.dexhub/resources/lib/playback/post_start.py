"""Post-start subtitle work, executed by the SERVICE — not the plugin.

v5.4.11. Until 5.4.10 the play dispatch spawned two threads that kept
running long after the plugin script returned:

  * ``DexHubSubtitleLifecycle`` — waited for AV, then ran the FULL broker
    discovery (15s budget) and downloaded every found subtitle file;
  * ``DexHubPlayPost``          — polled up to 25s for real media, then
    applied/selected the elected subtitle track.

Kodi's CPythonInvoker cannot finish while any thread of its interpreter is
alive (``CPythonInvoker(...): waiting on thread`` in the log — one line per
blocking thread, exactly what invokers 119 and 220 showed).  While it waits,
the invoker never reaches ``InvokerStateScriptDone``, so with
``reuselanguageinvoker=true`` the next dispatch cannot reuse it: Kodi
releases the stuck invoker asynchronously and builds a FRESH sub-interpreter
instead.  Every playback therefore left a zombie interpreter whose threads
kept calling Player APIs and downloading files — and stop → instant replay
put that churn exactly inside the Amlogic display-pipeline reset while the
new dispatch was being wired up.  That collision is the hard freeze.

The rule now: a plugin invocation exits with ZERO surviving threads.  The
dispatch only *publishes a job* (one Window-property write, done before
``Player.play``); the long-lived service companion consumes it on its own
``onPlayBackStarted`` and runs the exact same work on a service-interpreter
thread, where no invoker lifecycle exists to block.

The job travels over a Home-window property (same transport as the session
store): written by the plugin interpreter, read+cleared by the service.
