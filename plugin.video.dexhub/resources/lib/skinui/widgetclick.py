"""OK on a Dex Hub item in a widget of the skin (v5.10.120).

A widget's list is a Kodi directory, and Kodi clicks it itself: a folder
opens in the Videos window (the add-on's own listing), a file is played
with PlayMedia. Two things went wrong with that in Arctic Fuse 3:

* a series from one of Dex Hub's catalogs, made a widget in the skin,
  opened the add-on's seasons listing instead of a page in the skin;
* Dex Hub's own rows answered PlayMedia's resolve with a failure to open
  their title page (items.kodi_click, v5.10.114): Kodi logged "Error
  resolving item ... skipping unplayable item" at every click, stopped
  what was playing (the trailer behind the Home, or the user's video in
  the background), and every click ran two add-on calls at once.

Kodi runs the item of a widget whose path is in its favourites form,
``favourites://<a builtin, url-encoded>``, as that builtin (Kodi 21 and
22, CDirectoryProvider::OnClick and CExecString): RunPlugin straight to
the title page, no resolve, nothing stopped, one call. The skin's own
lists with click actions (skin.dexhub, the folder page) never get these
paths: their Info action needs the item itself.
