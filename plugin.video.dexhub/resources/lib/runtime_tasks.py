"""Bounded runner for optional Dex Hub background work.

Kodi keeps the Python interpreter alive between plugin invocations.  Creating
one daemon thread for every cache warm, logo refresh, artwork refresh and
manual sync therefore accumulates native threads on long CoreELEC sessions.
This module gives those *optional* one-shot jobs one shared two-worker lane,
deduplicates equivalent jobs and bounds the waiting queue.

Playback, source-result polling and service loops deliberately do not use this
runner: those jobs own a lifecycle and must remain independently cancellable.

    """A small worker pool whose threads exit on their own once idle.

    v5.10.92. concurrent.futures workers are not daemon threads and, once
    their job is done, park on the work queue forever. The module-level
    executor this replaces was never shut down (shutdown_lane_pools only
    closes dexhub.client's lanes), so after any optional job two idle
    DexHub-bg workers stayed alive. Kodi's invoker waits for every thread of
    a finished plugin script before it can reuse the interpreter: the macOS
    crash report of 24 Sep shows one invoker in that wait loop, held by
    exactly DexHub-bg_0 and DexHub-bg_1 idling in queue.get, while the next
    click had to start a fresh interpreter behind the busy dialog.

    Workers here wait at most ``idle_seconds`` for more work and then exit,
    so a finished invocation is left with no DexHub threads a moment after its
    last job. ``submit(fn)`` keeps the executor's contract used by the
    callers: it never blocks, and it raises only when no worker exists and
    none can be started.
